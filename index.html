                <h5>Thor</h5>
                <p>
                  Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, is a mighty warrior with
                  control over lightning and storms. As the son of Odin and heir
                  to the throne of Asgard, Thor wields the enchanted hammer,
                  Mjölnir, which grants him immense power and the ability to
                  fly. Known for his immense strength, bravery, and a sense of
                  honor, Thor defends both his home and Earth from various
                  cosmic threats. His journey involves not only battling
                  formidable foes but also grappling with his own destiny and
                  the responsibilities of leadership. With his fierce
                  determination and godly prowess, Thor is a formidable hero and
                  a key member of the Avengers.
